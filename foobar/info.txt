-- Associate file type icons

The portable version doesn't modify registry, so it doesn't create file associations.
To associate manually file icons, run the registry file, foobar_file_icons.reg
and execute the AutoHotkey v2 script refresh_icons.ahk, or sign out to make OS to assign new icons.

Also, this C# code can be executed from PowerShell to do the same Win32 API call

$code = @'
  [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport("Shell32.dll")] 
  private static extern int SHChangeNotify(int eventId, int flags, IntPtr item1, IntPtr item2);
  public static void Refresh()  {
      SHChangeNotify(0x8000000, 0x1000, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero);    
  }
'@
Add-Type -MemberDefinition $code -Namespace WinAPI -Name Explorer 
[WinAPI.Explorer]::Refresh()


It seems that in some cases the icons associations can break.  
(for example, after installing another media player, or installing/uninstalling the non-portable version of foobar)  
In such weird cases, this guide may be followed to allow the program to build the associations:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/foobar2000/comments/14avgvq/how_to_make_foobar2000_portable_with_shell

Basically, as was tested, the "foobar2000 Shell Associations Updater.exe" is needed in the program folder.  
Then, when removing/renaming the "portable_mode_enabled" and opening the program, it uses that executable to assign the correct associations.  
(Supposing that the "icons" folder is also in the same program folder)

Then, if icons still don't show, assigning foobar as default media player may help (in Settings -> Apps or in the properties of an audio file)
